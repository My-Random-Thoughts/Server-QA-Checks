### Change Log At The End
# Server QA Checks

The QA Checks came about as a need to verify the build and configuration of any servers in several different environments.
All servers should be built from a standard gold build image; however this image still lacks many of the additional tools and configuration settings that are needed before a server can be taken in to support.

The manual process takes over 2 hours to complete, per server.  These scripts are completed in about 60 seconds.

They have been written using the Microsoft PowerShell scripting language, with a minimum supported version of 2.  This is due to Windows Server 2008 R2 (the lowest supported operating system) having this version installed by default.

The scripts can be run on any Windows operating system, either locally or remotely, as long as PowerShell version 2 or greater is installed, and the PowerShell command window is run with administrative privileges.  The only officially supported operating systems however are listed below...

### Supported Operating Systems
- Windows Server 2008 R2
- Windows Server 2012
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2016

#### Also works, but not supported
- Windows 2003 Server

## Please read the documentation and Wiki before starting out

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Quick Start:
1. Open a PowerShell console with administrative privileges
2. Change to the correct folder for where the scripts are held
3. Enter "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted –Force" to enable the script to run
4. Enter either:    
   - QA_(version).ps1 [-ComputerName] server01[, server02, server03, ...]
   - QA_(version).ps1 [-ComputerName] (Get-Content -Path c:\path\list.txt)
5. Wait for the script to complete
6. View the report(s) in the C:\QA\Results folder

# Script Configuration For Your Specific Environment
To customise the configuration settings for your environment, use the **QA Settings Configuration Tool**.  This is a GUI form (written entirely in PowerShell) that makes it easier for you to enable/disable specific checks as well as configure the specific settings for each QA check.

More details can be found on the project wiki: https://github.com/My-Random-Thoughts/Server-QA-Checks/wiki/QA-Settings-Configuration-Tool

# Basic Change Log

2018/01/18
- SEC-18 - Added new check for the Spectre issue

2017/09/03
- NET-09 - Added option to check if a specific destination IP does not exist "DestinationMustNotExist".
- SEC-15 - Added current firewall state to report output
- ENGINE - Added an internal check that gets system information about the currently scanned server (OS, CPU, RAM) and adds it to the reports


2017/08/12
- Lots of minor changes to files
- Larger changes to:

-- COM-12 - Added more default exclusions

-- DRV-05 - Now shows the location of any shared folders

-- NET-06 - Added check for 2012+ servers not needing native drivers

-- SYS-07 - Now showing any disabled devices

-- SYS-09 - Changed task author to show RunAs account

- Changed NET-09 to have a switch option of "AllMustExist".  This will allow you to have a range or static routes where only one or two may apply to a particular server.  Will still fail if none of them match.  Please add to your settings INI files the following line under the `[NET09]` section: `AllMustExist = 'False'`

2017/07/18
- New report layout and style.  I have created a new report style that I think looks much better than the old one.  Example reports are located in the root on this project.  Let me know what you think.  This report will hopefully become the new normal by the end of August 2017.  You can start using it by compiling your scripts with the `CompilerR2.ps1` script.
